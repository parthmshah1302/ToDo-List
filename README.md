You can add your pending tasks in the input box

When you complete a task, you can single-click on the task name.

This would strike out the task and change it&#39;s colour to green, which helps the user to differentiate between the pending and the remaining tasks.

When you want to delete the task, you can double click on the Task name. This would remove the child (which was appended in the previous step), hence deleting the task
